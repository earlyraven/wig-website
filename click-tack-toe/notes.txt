Can try online:
https://playcode.io/typescript

transpile commnad:
npx tsc --outFile ~/Desktop/Projects/TypeScript/ts_playground/change_html/dist/script-transpiled.js ~/Desktop/Projects/TypeScript/ts_playground/change_html/src/script.ts 

shorter (from project dir... just outside "src" and "dist" directories):
npx tsc --outFile dist/script-transpiled.js src/script.ts 

note:
make sure index.html is using the .js as it's source (unless using the online playcode above; then it should be the .ts)
