    <h2>JavaScript Image Toggler</h2>
    <h3>What's This Project About?</h3>
    <p>This project showcases how JavaScript can be used to make an interactive web page. Specifically, it showcases how a button can be coded to toggle an image between two states - on and off - when clicked.</p>
    
    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows manipulatation of HTML elements to create interactive features on a web page. In this project, two JavaScript functions - <code>turnOn()</code> and <code>turnOff()</code> - are used to switch between two different images. These functions work by changing the <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>img</code> tag to point to a different image file.</p>

    <h3>Why Is This Useful?</h3>
    <p>By using JavaScript to create interactive features on a web page, content can become more engaging and responsive to user input. This project could be adapted to create image galleries, slideshows, and other types of image-based applications that respond to user actions.</p>

    <button id="turnOnButton">Turn on the light</button>
    <img id="lightImage" src="single_light_off.svg" style="width:100px">
    <button id="turnOffButton">Turn off the light</button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
